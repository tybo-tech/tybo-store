## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- Angular CLI 18+
- PHP 8+ (for backend API)

### Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone [repository-url]
cd tybo-store-v2

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
ng serve --port 4201

# Access the applications:
# Storefront: http://localhost:4201/
# Dashboard: http://localhost:4201/dashboard
# Editor: http://localhost:4201/editor
```
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.
